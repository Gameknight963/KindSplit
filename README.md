Livesplit autosplitting for MSZ

**Do NOT submit runs with this tool to Speedrun.com.** I don't know if it's allowed yet.

## Installation

To install:

```
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Programs\MiSide Zero Alpha
```

2. **Place KindSplit.dll inside your 'Mods'** folder once Melonloader is installed.

3. Start the LiveSplit TCP server. Right click timer > Control > Start TCP server

## Usage

Upon loading into the gameplay, Livesplit will start automatically. Upon finishing the game, livesplit *adds a new split,* which ends the run. **Do not add segments using this tool, it will break.**
